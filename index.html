            <p>I'm a contract, remote and office experienced web developer with over 7 years experience in a myriad of environments, projects and skills.

            <h1 class="SecondaryColor FGC">Intent</h1>
            <p>It takes a design mindset to translate the concept of a project into code. A business mindset understands how development is dependent on communication and feedback-driven iteration.<br>
            <span class="more LinkColor" sel="01">more</span>
            </p>            
            <p class="hide" id="p01">These two mindsets compliment each other. Design is more then a visual discipline. Business sense is an integral part of development. Both are best informed by guiding principles and values rather then procedures and systems. Each person has talents, knowledge and perspectives that add to the collective effort. Leveraging this knowledge is the greatest asset to any project- procedures change and systems evolve. Day by day, its the people who make these endeavors possible.<br>
            <span class="more LinkColor" sel="02">more</span>
            </p>
            <p class="hide" id="p02">I have developed skills and knowledge across the spectrum of design and development while retaining a sense of the greater picture I'm part of. I've worked with designers to translate their work into live code - then iterated and developed with the network engineers while communicating the entire process with project management and ownership. I'm excited by new challenges and always improve my skills within a profitable framework for myself and my employers.</p>

                <p class="hide">Original site development and initial Wordpress environment configured by outside dev group. Additional layout, menu, text and UI work completed by me over three months. Created multiple sub pages with their page builder and utilized PHP, CSS and HTML in order to add and modify functionality of the carts, shipping calculations and other details that were best kept as second layer (DOM) dynamics rather then CMS handled statics. Wrote the blog posts: optimized for SEO which was tracked with online tools and driven by regional search statistics and industry leading goods, services and purchases. Worked with remote marketing team to facilitate digital ecology including Facebook, Twitter and Instagram feed with syndicated content to company specifications. </p>

                <p class="hide">Client approached me over application format: standard expectation at the time was a 'smart' pdf with backup paper materials provided. This traditional application process required the HR and MGMT group to keep track of multiple formats per each applicant. Materials were cross checked in case of PDF issues. Each applicant took a significant time investment to review. We developed a digital application in web form that utilized IBM visual language; hosted on their secure web infrastructure (bluemix/git). The application was praised for its tech integration as well as the overwhelming simplicity compared to most pdf/paper applications. The application was such a stark contrast to the norm that future applications were requested in web accessible format.</p>

                <p>Third generation representation of client group. Site base changed to WIX as expeditionary test of database and data handling integrated CMS.

                <p class="hide">The media heavy sections for the site were built using database objects rather then specifically build the links. Wix editing system excells at dynamic data but lacks any specialized CSS or layout tools. Left oriented layout mathmatics were utilized to keep pull quotes in their specified order without covering up actual content. Specially ordered placeholders were populated for the area the quotes are placed. According to WIX documentation, many of the results we produced were not possible.</p>
