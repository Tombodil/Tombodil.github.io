            <p>Anyone can build a site and learn as they go. It takes a design mindset to translate the soul of a project into code. It takes a business mindset to understand how development is dependant on communication and feedback-driven iteration. </p>
            <p>I dont believe these two mindsets are mutually exclisive. Design is more then a visual discipline. Buisiness sense shouldn't be a four letter word to developers. Both are best informed by guiding principles and values rather then focus on procudyres and systems. Each person has talents, knowledge and perspectives that add to the collective effort. Leverging the people involved is the greatest asset to any project- procedures change and systems evolve. Dad by day, its the people who make the magic happen.</p>
            <p>How do I fit into all this high-minded exposition? I have developed skills and knowledge across the spectrum of design and development while retaining a sense of the greater picture I'm a part of. I worked with designers to translate their work into live code that I've then iterated and developed with the network engineers while comminicating the whole process with project management and ownership. I'm the developer equivalent of a mutli-cable, able to adapt any given input into a differently formatted output.</p>

                <p>Online Trucking source and drop sale site. Original site development and initial wordpress environment configured by Vouelger Group Inc. Additional layout, menu, text and UI work completed by me over three months. Created multiple sub pages with their page builder and utilized php and html code in order to add and modify functionality of the carts, shipping calculations and other details that were best kept as second layer (DOM) dynamics rather then CMS handled statics. Blog posts were mine as well. Pages and blog posts were optimized for SEO which was tracked with online tools and driven by regional serch statistics and industry leading goods, services and purchases. Worked with remote marketing team to facilitate digital ecology including facebook, twitter and instagram feed with syndicated content to company specifications. </p>
